# Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to serve as a blueprint for the development of my personal project, currently named **GPX Editor**. This document will be used to guide the development of the project, and will be updated as the project progresses.

### 1.2 Scope

The project is a visual editor for files exported from an iOS app called Arc. Arc is a GPS tracking app that allows users to record their activities, such as walking, biking, running, etc. The app can export the recorded activity as either JSON or GPX files. The web app has the ability to import these files and display the activity on a map. The user can then edit the activities by adding, removing, or moving points on the map. The edited activity can then be saved to a database, or made into a timelapse video.

The web app is intended for the users of the Arc app, and will be hosted on a website. It is intended to run on any modern browser.

## 2. User Requirements

The user will be able to:

- Import files from the Arc app
- See the activity displayed on a map
  - Visits are marked with pins and have a radius indicating accuracy
  - Activities are drawn as lines, colored based on the activity type
- Edit a visit
  - Choose from nearby places
  - Manually set place
  - Remove the visit
- Edit an activity
  - Adding points
  - Removing points
  - Moving points
  - Snapping points to a road
- Bulk edit data
- Filter data
  - By activity type
  - By date
    - Day, week, month, year, all
    - Custom date range
  - By location
- Export filtered data
  - GPX
  - GeoJson
  - Timelapse video
- Save data to account

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

#### 3.1.1 Importing Files

The user must be able to import files from the Arc app, stored locally on the user's computer. These files must be in either JSON or GPX format, as generated by the Arc app. The user must be able to import multiple files at once.

After importing the files, the user should be able to edit the data (in bulk, see [3.1.3](#313-editing-data)). After the user is satisfied, they must be able to save the data to their account.

#### 3.1.2 Displaying Data

The data must be displayed on a map. Visits should be marked as dots, and activities should be drawn as lines. The lines must be colored based on the activity type.

The user must be able to filter the data. There are multiple ways to do this:

- By activity type: select any combination of activities to display.
- By date: filter by day, week, month, year, or a custom date range.
- By location: filter by a bounding box on the map.

### 3.1.3 Editing Data

The user must be able to choose the location of a visit by selecting one of the nearby places (possibly finetuning the exact locating using the map). Alternatively, they can set whether the visit is a one-time visit (for example, "bike broke down" or "stopped to look at the view") or it's a place. Lastly, they must also be able to remove the visit to merge the samples into the activities above and below.

The user must also be able to edit activities on the map. They can do this by snapping data points to a road, and by adding, moving and removing data points.

The user must be able to edit multiple data points at once. For example, they must be able to select multiple points and remove them all at once.

### 3.1.4 Exporting Data

The user must be able to export the data in either GPX or GeoJson format. They must also be able to export the data as a timelapse video. The timelapse should have settings, such as the area to show and the length of the output.

### 3.1.5 Saving Data

The user must be able to create an account, and save their data to it. They must also be able to load their data from their account by logging in.

### 3.2 Non-functional Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Performance

The app must be able to handle large amounts of data. The user must be able to import, view and edit data over years. The app must be able to handle this without crashing, and without taking too long to load.

#### 3.2.2 Security

The app must be secure. The user's data must be stored securely, and the user must be able to log in securely.

#### 3.2.3 Compatibility

The app must be compatible with all modern browsers. It could also be made into a mobile app, but this is not a requirement.
